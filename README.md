# Competitive Programming Repository

This repository contains a collection of programming solutions primarily sourced from **Codeforces**. Most of the problems featured here are from the **Codeforces** platform. However, if any problem is sourced from a different platform, it will be clearly indicated alongside the problem's title.

## Problem Sources

- **Codeforces**: The majority of problems here are from **Codeforces** contests, ranging from easy to advanced problems.
- **Other Platforms**: For problems taken from other platforms, the source will be mentioned explicitly in the problem's title for clarity.

Feel free to explore the solutions and contribute to the repository!
